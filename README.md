# Project Formik Pattern

## 🚀 Overview

This project was initially created to **easily and type-safely implement a multi-step form**, ensuring full control and security throughout the process. Additionally, it allows you to create your own **custom inputs** leveraging the power of Formik. This approach can also be easily adapted to other libraries such as **React Hook Form**.

This project demonstrates how to implement **Formik** in a real-world scenario with a scalable input structure, real-time translations, and more. The most important feature covered is the implementation of a **multi-step form**, which can be challenging to structure effectively.
